tibble with columns:

\section{Blended vs. Unblended}{

\itemize{
\item Unblended: Unblended costs represent your usage costs on the day
they are charged to you
\item Blended: Blended costs are calculated by multiplying each accountâ€™s
service usage against something called a blended rate. A blended rate
is the average rate of on-demand usage, as well as Savings Plans- and
reservation-related usage, that is consumed by member accounts in an
organization for a particular service.
}
}

\section{Historical data}{

If you supply a \code{date_start} older than 14 months prior to today's date
you will likely see an error like "You haven't enabled historical data
beyond 14 months". See
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-advanced-cost-analysis.html} #nolint
for help
}

\section{Filtering}{

You can optionally pass a list to the \code{filter} argument to filter AWS costs
by different dimensions, tags, or cost categories. This filter expression is
passed on to
\href{https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/docs/costexplorer_get_cost_and_usage/}{paws}. See
possible dimensions:
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetDimensionValues.html}) #nolint

This is supplied as a list, with key-value pairs for each criteria.
Different filter criteria can be combined in different ways using \code{AND},
\code{OR}, and \code{NOT}. See Examples below and more on Filter expressions at
\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html}. #nolint
