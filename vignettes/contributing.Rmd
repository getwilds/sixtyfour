## General guidelines

This article outlines how to propose a change to `sixtyfour`. For more information about contributing to this, and other WILDS projects, please see the [**WILDS Contributing Guide**](https://getwilds.org/guide/).

### Fixing typos/docs changes

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

### Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.

If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal
reproducible example using [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

Note that this package has a `Makefile` in the root of the repository - see the targets in the `Makefile` for various package maintenance tasks.

### Git Flow

This package follows [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In brief, there's two main branches: `main` and `dev`. `main` is considered to be more or less "production-ready" and at any given time should be associated with the most recent release. The `dev` branch has the most recent state of the in development code for the package. When `dev` reaches a state where we're ready for a release, we'll merge `dev` back to `main` and cut a release. When you make a feature branch, please branch off of `dev`.

#### Pull request process

* Fork the package and clone onto your computer
* Checkout the `dev` branch
* Create a Git branch off of `dev` for your pull request (PR)
* Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a pull request against `dev`.
  * The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
  * The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.
* For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the `NEWS.md` file.

#### Code style

* New/edited code should follow the [WILDS style guide](https://getwilds.org/guide/style.html).

## Testing

We strive to have all tests that do HTTP requests do so against resources that are not actual AWS accounts given the drawbacks with using real accounts, e.g., setting them up can be difficult at some organizations; forgotten resources can be expensive; accidentally making unwated changes to an account, etc.

We use two tools to replace real AWS accounts: Minio, Localstack.

### Minio

We use [Minio][] for testing two sets of functions in this package for interacting with S3:

- tests in `test-buckets.R`
- tests in `test-files.R`

#### Local

`sixtyfour` tests that use Minio will just be skipped if you don't have Minio running.

To use Minio, first install it for your platform: [MacOS](https://min.io/docs/minio/macos/index.html), [Windows](https://min.io/docs/minio/windows/index.html), [Linux](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html).

Next, start Minio. Within this package is a make target `minio_start` for starting Minio locally; it should only work on Linux and MacOS platforms.

Upon starting Minio it will display URLs for both the Minio API and WebUI - and your username/password to login to the WebUI. You can open up the WebUI as a nice visual dashboard of what's going on.

#### GitHub Actions

The `R-CMD-check` workflow in `.github/workflows/` includes spinning up Minio for running unit tests - but only on Linux; tests that require Minio are skipped on MacOS and WIndows platforms on GitHub Actions.

#### Minio Details

The following information (collapsed) is for those who want to know more about the minio setup, and may want to tweak it or add minio setup to other tests.

<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>

- `tests/testthat/helper-minio.R` has helper functions for Minio. `bucket_delete` and `buckets_empty` make it easier to do cleanup in tests. The `minio_available` function is to be used inside `skip_if_not` to skip the tests in the file if Minio is not available, like: `skip_if_not(minio_available(), "Minio Not Available")`
- At the top of any file that uses Minio, setup the interfaces to Minio like:

```r
Sys.setenv(AWS_PROFILE = "minio")
```

- And unset at the bottom of the file to cleanup:

```r
Sys.unsetenv("AWS_PROFILE")
```

Internally we grab client objects for `paws` and `s3fs` as needed and use `AWS_PROFILE` env var to toggle on/off using Minio.

For Minio we use the default credentials:

- Access key id: `minioadmin` (override with env var `MINIO_USER`)
- Secret access key: `minioadmin` (override with env var `MINIO_PWD`)
- Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (override with env var `MINIO_ENDPOINT`)

You can override these defaults by setting the env vars above to your own values.

### Localstack

We use [Localstack][ls] for testing some functions in this package:

- tests in `test-groups.R`
- tests in `test-policies.R`
- tests in `test-roles.R`
- tests in `test-s3.R`
- tests in `test-secrets_manager.R`
- tests in `test-users.R`
- tests in `test-vpc.R`

#### Local

`sixtyfour` tests that use Localstack will just be skipped if you don't have Localstack running.

To use Localstack, first install it for your platform <https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/>.

Next, start Localstack. Within this package is a make target `localstack_start` for starting Localstack locally. That make target should only work on Linux and MacOS platforms.

For a GUI interface to the locally running localstack you can install the Desktop client - which isn't very good - at <https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-desktop>. Better yet, login to the cloud Localstack site and you can interface with your locally running Localstack in the better interface there. Login at <https://app.localstack.cloud/>.

#### GitHub Actions

The `R-CMD-check` workflow in `.github/workflows/` includes spinning up Localstack for running unit tests - but only on Linux; tests that require Localstack are skipped on MacOS and WIndows platforms on GitHub Actions.

#### Localstack Details

The following (collapsed) bullets list information for those who want to know more about the Localstack setup, and that may want to tweak it or add Localstack setup to other tests.

<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>

- `tests/testthat/helper-localstack.R` has helper functions for Localstack. The `localstack_available` function is to be used inside `skip_if_not` to skip the tests in the file if Localstack is not available, like: `skip_if_not(localstack_available(), "Localstack Not Available")`
- At the top of any file that uses Localstack, setup the interfaces to Localstack like:

```r
Sys.setenv(AWS_PROFILE = "localstack")
```

- And unset at the bottom of the file to cleanup:

```r
Sys.unsetenv("AWS_PROFILE")
```

Internally we grab client objects for `paws` and `s3fs` as needed and use `AWS_PROFILE` env var to toggle on/off using Localstack.

For Localstack we use the default credentials:

- Access key id: `NOTAREALKEY` (override with env var `LOCALSTACK_KEY`)
- Secret access key: `AREALLYFAKETOKEN` (override with env var `LOCALSTACK_SECRET`)
- Endpoint: `http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566` (override with env var `LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT`)

You can override these defaults by setting the env vars above to your own values.
