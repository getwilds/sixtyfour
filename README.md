- Support for row level security in PostgreSQL and Redshift (via `tablemanners` package) ([#75](https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/issues/75)) - for this package, the change may only be documentation on how to use `tablemanners` with `sixtyfour`
- Cookbook docs based around common usage patterns ([#27](https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/issues/27))
- Finish magic function `six_bucket_upload` ([#67](https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/issues/67))
- Send to CRAN ([#68](https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/issues/68))
